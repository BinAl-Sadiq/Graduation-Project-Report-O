\section{Problem Statement}
Navigating indoor environments is challenging for visually impaired individuals, directly affecting their independence and daily activities. While some existing technologies have developed separate algorithms for indoor localization, they are often not integrated into a user-friendly device that individuals can easily use. Moreover, many solutions rely on expensive sensors, increasing the overall cost of the device. Additionally, the majority of current aids do not provide a cohesive approach that combines accurate localization with obstacle detection, and they often lack context-specific, non-visual instructions tailored to the unique needs of visually impaired users. This highlights the urgent need for an affordable, integrated indoor navigation system that enhances mobility and independence in everyday settings.
