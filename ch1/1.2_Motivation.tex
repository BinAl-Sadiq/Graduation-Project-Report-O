\section{Motivation}
This project is motivated by the need to enhance the quality of life and autonomy for visually impaired individuals, especially in interior settings where conventional navigation aids such as GPS are inadequate. Visually impaired individuals encounter significant obstacles when navigating intricate indoor environments, which can restrict their mobility and independence. Existing options, such as guide dogs and human aid, although beneficial, may prove inadequate or unworkable in all situations.
The motivation also is to develop a prototype solution utilising commonly accessible technology (such as QR codes and mobile devices) enhances the system's accessibility to a broader audience (Cost and Accessibility). This differs from expensive or complex systems that may require specialized hardware.
