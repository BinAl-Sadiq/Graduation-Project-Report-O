\section{Overview}
\color{red}
This project focuses on using a camera and QR codes for precise localization, allowing the device to determine its exact location. When the camera scans a QR code, it not only identifies where it is but can also trigger additional features like specific instructions or location-based descriptions. This localization system is particularly useful for robots to navigate accurately or for visually impaired people to receive important information about their surroundings.
