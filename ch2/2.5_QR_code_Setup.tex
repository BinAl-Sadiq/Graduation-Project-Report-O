\subsection{QR Codes Setup \& Design}

There are a lot of different ways of how we can setup our QR Codes for the indoor localization system. For example, we can put them on the ceiling, floor, inside a hanging panel, on walls, or any other place you can think of. In our proposed system, we want to create it in such a way that it work fine despite where they are put at, so we will not really care about this.

One significant question that might come to your mind after thinking about a building full of QR Codes is: "Wouldn't this make the building looks distorted and ugly?!". Our answer is: Well, it depends. For example,QR Codes can have custom shapes and colors that might make the place where it is put in looks more pretty if they where designed correctly. Imagine colorful codes with custom cartoonie shapes at the ceiling of a children school. And in this project, we are rally just providing a concept of the system, so the QR Codes can be replaced with any other thing depending on the needs. So depending on how someone is going to implement this system, the artificial markers - whether they are QR Codes or not - might make the building look better or worse, and they even can be designed in a way making the very difficult to find and recognize as if they do not even exist at all.
