\subsection{Artificial Landmarks}

While both natural and artificial landmarks are used in computer science applications, artificial landmarks can provide distinct advantages in terms of control, precision, reliability, adaptability, and data encoding. Also there are tons of library that support encoding, detecting, decoding, and tracking artificial landmarks. There are wide variety of artificial markers such as QR, Arcuo, Topotag, and other dozens of markers, see [2] for more details.
