\section{Camera Module}

Camera modules are essential in embedded systems, enabling devices to capture images and videos for processing. These modules consist of an image sensor, lens, and support circuitry, allowing them to connect with microcontrollers and single-board computers. 

They are classified by resolution, power consumption, compatibility, and imaging quality. The OV series from OmniVision, a leading CMOS image sensor supplier, is popular in applications like surveillance, IoT, and computer vision. We will discuss three commonly used models: OV2640, OV7670, and OV5640.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{OV2640}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2-megapixel (1600 x 1200 pixels) CMOS sensor.
		\item Low-power, compact module; widely used with ESP32.
		\item Supports JPEG, YUV, and RGB formats.
		\item Suitable for IoT due to low-resolution operation, reduced processing, and memory needs.
		\item Includes automatic white balance, exposure control, and image enhancement for various lighting conditions. \cite{OV2640}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{OV7670}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item VGA (640 x 480 pixels), 0.3-megapixel sensor.
		\item Ideal for basic image tasks: color tracking, object detection, line following.
		\item Low cost, compatible with microcontrollers like Arduino.
		\item Includes image scaling, automatic white balance, and gamma correction. \cite{OV7670}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{OV5640}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 5-megapixel (2592 x 1944 pixels) sensor, high-resolution.
		\item Supports JPEG, RAW, YUV formats; suitable for facial recognition and barcode scanning.
		\item Features autofocus and advanced imaging controls.
		\item Requires higher processing power, suitable for Raspberry Pi and other capable platforms. \cite{OV5640}
