We want to express our deep gratitude to Dr. Moteb Alghamdi for his invaluable guidance and support throughout our graduation project. We appreciate how he started meeting and guiding us while the year had barely started. He constantly checks our work, ensuring everything is done on time and correctly. Thank you, Dr. Moteb, for your kind spirit and for always staying in touch and helping us.


Also, We are incredibly grateful to our families for meeting all our needs and allowing us to focus on our work. They provide us with a comfortable environment and endless emotional support, for which we are forever grateful.
