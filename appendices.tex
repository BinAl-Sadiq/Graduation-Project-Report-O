\section{The divided environment method}

The idea of dividing an environment into smaller pieces is widely used in
some industries in different ways and purposes. One of these industries is the video game industry. A huge amount of video games divide the game world
into a chunk of squares, triangles, hexagons, and other shapes depending on the
gameâ€™s need and performance. But the difference here is that they do not use
this technique for localization since the positions for all the objects in the games
are known and stored at the RAMs already. They use the technique to categorize
the pieces such as walkable ground, water, lava, rocks, and so on. Then these
pieces are used along with their categories to find a proper path between two
points. Different path finding algorithms can be used, but the most popular and
simple one is A* algorithm. See this [4] incredible youtube tutorial made by
Sebastian Lague, that explain an implementation of the A* algorithm and how
it can be optimized.
