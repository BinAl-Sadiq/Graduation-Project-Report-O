\vspace{6pt}
Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges when navigating indoor environments, especially if they were not familiar with these environments. Indoor spaces are often unpredictable, filled with obstacles, and designed with critical visual information intended for sighted individuals. These challenges create a reliance on external assistance, such as asking for help from strangers or using companions, which can diminish the independence of visually impaired individuals. This project aims to provide a solution through a wearable, easy-to-use, and low-cost system that guides and assists users navigating in such environments. 

The proposed system integrates four core components: Obstacle Detection, Localization, Customizable Guidance, and a Management Dashboard. These components work together to enhance the navigation experience for visually impaired individuals. The Obstacle Detection System detects obstacles in the userâ€™s path and provides tactile feedback through vibration motors, enhancing spatial awareness. The Localization System uses QR codes as artificial landmarks to determine the user's pose, providing an accurate and reliable indoor localization. The Customizable Guidance System delivers tailored, location-specific instructions that assists and inform users about their current places, and it also helps users navigate effectively through designated areas by guiding them to the correct paths. Additionally, the Management Dashboard allows building managers to easily integrate the system into their facilities by enabling them to generate, manage, and deploy QR codes within the building.

By integrating these components, the system ensures a practical and cost-effective solution for improving mobility, independence, and accessibility for visually impaired individuals, while also simplifying adoption for building managers.
