Visually impaired and blind individuals might face difficult challenges when navigating through indoor environments, especially if they where not familiar with them. Indoor environments can be very unpredictable and filled with obstacles, and they are rich of important visual information which only designed for eyes consumption. These difficulties rise the need of these individuals to assistants and guiders whether by asking strangers, or by taking companions. But
these solutions will lead to decreasing the independence of these individuals. We are trying to offer a solution in this project, a wearable and easy to use system that guides and assists the users after determining their positions and scanning their surrounding environments using only a camera and smart phone. 

The proposed system is an integration of three systems: Objects Detection, Localization, and Customizable Guidance System. These components rely on analyzing the images captured by a camera and extracting the important visual information from them. The Objects Detection System can detects the surrounding objects and describe them to the users if they asked to, and informusers about obstacles, and users can ask it to alarm them when they face an object with certain characteristics, such as a man wearing red T-Shirt. The localization system will use the camera to detect artificial landmarks to determine the userâ€™s location. And finally, the Customizable Guidance System reads to user custom information and instructions after entering specific areas.
