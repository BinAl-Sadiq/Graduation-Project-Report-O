\section{Object Detection and Identification}
As discussed in Chapter 2.8, Object Detection, YOLO ended up being a solid choice thanks to it's realtime capabilities and lightweight computing cost, however, since the release of the paper, it had multiple versions and improvements, we ended up with the YOLOv10, a readymade python package for ease-of-use and lightweight performance. To implement it, we would have to train it, we chose the objects trashcan and chair to be our simple stepping stone. We also have to use a framework that allows us to make use of the model, tensorflow lite allows for the model to be used in a constrained environment (like ours) so we chose it.
