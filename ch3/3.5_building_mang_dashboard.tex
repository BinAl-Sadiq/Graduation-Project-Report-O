\section{Building Management Dashboard}

The Building Management Dashboard is a web-based tool that allows building administrators to manage the indoor navigation system effectively. This dashboard provides an interface to control and update QR code instructions and manage QR codes within the building remotely.

Key features include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User Authentication:} Allows administrators to securely log in and access only their managed buildings.
	\item \textbf{Building and Floor Management:} Displays a list of buildings and their respective floors, allowing administrators to organize and view all QR codes assigned to each area.
	\item \textbf{QR Code Instruction Editing:} Administrators can add, update, or delete instructions for each QR code in the building, tailoring guidance to specific areas and ensuring data accuracy.
\end{itemize}
