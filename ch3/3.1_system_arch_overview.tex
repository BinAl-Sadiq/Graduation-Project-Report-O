\section{System Architecture Overview}

In this section, you can present the overall structure of your indoor navigation system and how its components interact. It should include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{High-level view of components:}
Briefly describe the components of the system, such as the user interface, QR code scanner, navigation logic, backend/database, and the device (mobile app).
\item \textbf{Data flow:}
Explain how data moves between components. For instance, when a QR code is scanned, how the information is sent to the navigation system and then displayed to the user.
\item \textbf{Technology Stack:}
List the technologies and tools you are using for each component, such as the development framework (e.g., Flutter for a mobile app), libraries for QR code scanning, and the backend services (e.g., Firebase for storing data).
\item \textbf{System diagram:}
 Include a diagram illustrating how different parts of the system interact.
\end{itemize}
