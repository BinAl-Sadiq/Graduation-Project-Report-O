The Mobile Application serves as the primary interface for visually impaired users, offering intuitive features that facilitate navigation in indoor environments. Designed with accessibility in mind, the app implements both the customizable guidance and localization systems, ensuring that users receive accurate and real-time navigation assistance.

The application functionality includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{QR Code Scanning:} The appâ€™s camera detects and decodes QR codes, automatically initiating the customizable guidance system. Upon scanning a QR code, the application identifies its unique ID, which is crucial for retrieving the corresponding navigation instructions from the central database.
