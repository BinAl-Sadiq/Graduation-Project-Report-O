\section{Overall System Evaluation}

\subsection{Experiment Design}

The overall system evaluation was conducted in a multi-room indoor facility simulating a real-world public building. The space included hallways, turns, open areas, and furniture that introduced natural obstacles and navigation challenges.

\textbf{Lighting Conditions:}  
The room had stable and sufficient lighting provided by ceiling-mounted fluorescent fixtures, ensuring clear visibility for QR code detection throughout the experiment.

\textbf{Building Layout:}  
A predefined navigation route was selected that included multiple turns, obstacle zones, and doorways. The total length of the route was approximately 15 meters and included four direction changes and several static obstacles, such as tables and chairs.

\textbf{Participant Setup:}  
Six participants took part in the evaluation. Each participant was blindfolded to simulate visual impairment. The mobile phone running the navigation system was mounted on a chest harness, while vibration feedback devices were worn around the waist. Participants also wore a pair of wireless earphones to receive audio instructions.

\subsection{Procedure}

Participants were randomly divided into two groups of three. The first group used the complete Mosaned system, which included QR-based localization, real-time audio guidance, and obstacle detection via vibration feedback. The second group relied on traditional navigation methods such as verbal instructions from a human assistant.

Each participant was asked to navigate independently from the starting point to the destination along the defined path. Observers recorded behavioral observations, including navigation errors, assistance required, and time taken. At the end of the experiment, participants completed a Likert-scale survey evaluating their experience.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

The evaluation metrics applied in this study are described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation_metrics} of the Methodology chapter. All results and analyses presented here are based on those metrics.


\subsection{Results}

The results of the user survey are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:user_survey}, which compares average ratings between the group using the proposed system and those using traditional methods. Each bar represents a category scored from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).
