\section{Experiment Design}

The experiment was structured around two main test cases designed to evaluate different aspects of the proposed system. The first test case focused on assessing the performance of the localization subsystem in isolation, while the second aimed to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the complete system, including localization, obstacle detection, and guidance features.
