\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

.\\.\\.\\.\\
Since our obstacle detection system is designed to be worn by a human, we found that having multiple wires running over the body was cumbersome and could restrict movement. In future work, we plan to address these issues by exploring wireless solutions to make the system more comfortable, user-friendly, and reliable for everyday use.
